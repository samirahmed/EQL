# EQL - Natural Language Email Querying

building an NL email querying interface prototype using a context free grammar

see `queries.txt` for the list of possible queries that we test against (there are way more possiblities not tested for)

see `grammar_test.py` to test out the CFG and ensure it can parse all the queries correctly

run `grammar_server.py` and issue requests along the lines of `http://localhost:8080/parse/<my email query>`
